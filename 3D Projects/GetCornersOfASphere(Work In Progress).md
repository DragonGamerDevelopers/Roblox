## Get the Corners of a sphere shaped Part
In this tutorial I will deal with getting the corners of a sphere shaped part. These can be used for many other things, for example to control a part into a certain region without using the function game.Workspace:FindPartInRegion3(). Let's start now. In this tutorial each corner is represented by a part which is 0.01x0.01x0.01. So you can see if the corner is really there where it should be. To get the corners of a non-rotating part you need a formula. For this it is better to paint a sketch. Here is what I painted (I'm not an artist so please no criticism):

In this sketch you can see how you can get all the corners of a sphere. I will use vectors, then only see the Picture and with a bit math we have our Idea!

Okay, but I can't read it. What are all these arrows? And what is this, or this and this? It's okay, though, because I'm here to help you. Like I said, I used vectors and because it's hard to paint in 3D, I painted it in 2D. Before we start to calculate the vertex of the ball we have to know the normal position. For this there is nothing better than a ball with radius 1 and the position at 0,0,0, so the center of the room, then export the whole thing as OBJ file and finally in a program, like Blender. For those of you who wonder why: How else can we get the vertices? Roblox does not currently allow to get the vertices in itself, so we need another program. In Blender, we should cut the ball in four through the vertical, then cut the ball in one through the horizontal. In total we should have 8 pieces. From here on everybody has his own method, but I would personally take the 1/8th that is positive, for those who don't figure out what I mean here is a picture of it:



Then we can switch to edit mode in Blender so you can move, modify, add vertices and most importantly: get their position. In Blender we then switch to this edit mode by pressing the Tab key or finding the GUI of it and just clicking it. Then we should press the N key: to the right of the viewport frame there should be a new GUI. Now comes one of the most boring and exhausting work there is: Getting every single vertex of that 1/8th of an inch. To get a better overview we should delete the other 7/8, be careful to delete only these vertices, not the whole OBJ model. When in Blender, move the camera with the middle button of the mouse. Attention: You need a mouse and no laptop integrated mouse. Then there are many other keys, but because Blender has so many key combinations I can't tell you all the basics. With the Z key you can see through the model by selecting wireframe. Then with the B key you can select multiple vertices and with the X key you can delete the selected vertices by selecting vertices. If you select a vertex with the left mouse click then the position of the vertex should appear in the GUI that came with the N key: By the way, you have to be careful because Blender uses the real vector system, so while in Roblox you form a vector like this: Vector3.new(x,y,z), the real vector system looks like this: Vector3.new(x,z,y), the z and y are fooled, so for example the height is the Z axis and not the Y axis. Then my plan is to add all received positions to the table. Now the question comes up: Why then use only 1/8 of the whole ball and not get all positions from every single vertex? The reason is simple: A RobloxBall has over 100 vertices, so it would be a real pain to control, copy and vectorize everything one by one. Why this particular 1/8th? You will see later.
